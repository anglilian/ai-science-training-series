AI could be used to improve people's quality of life through predicting potential diseases that are likely to passed to them through genetics or put them at higher risk. We could feed the DNA sequence to a random forest (high complexity) based on other known DNA sequences and health reports. The model could then predict diseases that a person is likely to have for preventative medicine. We could optimise the model based on recall and train models for each disease we aim to predict.
